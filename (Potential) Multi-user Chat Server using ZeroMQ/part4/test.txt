HOW TO TEST:

1. Open up five termiinals and navigate to the directory part4.
2. Entered the following commands on each of the terminals in the following order:
    - python mc_server.py 127.0.0.1 4000 5000
    - python mc_client.py 127.0.0.1 4000 5000 ALL kyle
    - python mc_client.py 127.0.0.1 4000 5000 ML dai
    - python mc_client.py 127.0.0.1 4000 5000 ML zach
    - python mc_client.py 127.0.0.1 4000 5000 OK nick
3. Try to type any message (for example, I ate chicken today.) on the terminal, which have the username of kyle (You will notice that nothing will be printed out because this channel is read only.)
4. Next, type any message (for example, I ate chicken today.) on the terminal, which have the username of dai (You will notice that your message will be printed out on terminals with usernames of kyle, zach, and dai only.)
5. Next, type any message (for example, I ate chicken today.) on the terminal, which have the username of zach (You will notice that your message will be printed out on terminals with usernames of kyle, dai, and zach only.)
6. Next, type any message (for example, I ate chicken today.) on the terminal, which have the username of nick (You will notice that your message will be printed out on terminals with usernames of kyle and nick only.)

As a result, from the above test, we can see that the program satisfies the requirements given in the exercise. Feel free to open up more terminals with different channels to test more deeply.
