    Function to handle incoming WRQs 
    Initializes empty array and empty set of ACKed packets 
    Then sends initial ACK 0 to indicate readiness 
    and listens for the first DATA packet to be received 
    Inside the main loop, the most recent incoming data packet 
    has its block number checked against previously ACKed packets. 
    If the number has been previously ACKed, server sends the ACK 
    again and waits for a response. This will continue until the 
    server receives a packet with an un-ACKed block number. 
    The server then finds the size of the data packet. If it is > 4, 
    i.e. it is more than just a header, the data from positions [4:]
    are appended to all_data. If the size of the packet is < 516, TFTP 
    says that data transmission has finished, and the server sends a 
    final ACK and closes the connection. 
    If data is 516 bytes, however, the transaction continues. An ACK 
    is sent for the packet, the packet block number is added to the set 
    of ACKed packets, and the server listens for a response. Once a response 
    comes through, it is checked against packs_acked as above, and the 
    process repeats until a packet of size < 516 bytes is received and ACKed 
    Once all data has been transmitted, handle_WRQ then writes all_data 
    to a file with the same name as the one the client transferred 
    Finally, the socket is closed.
